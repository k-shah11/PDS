I used data from IHDS to assess how PDS affects calories consumed in the state of Andhra Pradesh using Propensity Score Matching and an Instrumental Variable analysis. 

Possession of a ration card is used as an IV 

The analysis shows how selection can bias OLS estimates. Since the less-privileged are more likely to use PDS and consume lower calories, OLS estimates show a negative relation between the two.
